## Description of the dataset and Kaggle project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/petfinder-adoption-prediction).

## The goal of this project was to interact first-hand with a dataset and to apply the different types of models learned in the classes. We created a Jupyter Notebook with everything done (processing of the csv files, models learned, and metrics performance).
